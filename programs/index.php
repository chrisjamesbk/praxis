				<p>The <strong>Praxis Spring Institute</strong> offers advanced young musicians the opportunity to train and perform with the Praxis faculty in an intensive week of workshops and rehearsals. The Institute provides:</p>
		
				<ul>
					<li>A chamber-sized orchestra in which 20-25 students (aged 18 and under) and 11 faculty-mentors play side-by-side in every rehearsal, ensuring that each student receives intensive, detailed and personalized coaching in an intimate
					and collegial playing environment.</li>
					<li>Rotating seating to give each member of the ensemble a chance to learn and contribute from multiple perspectives and to understand how each musician influences the sound of the whole.</li>
					<li>Multiple sectional rehearsals to fine-tune ensemble playing within each section.</li>
					<li>Intensive coaching in section leadership and collaboration, orchestral body-language, repertoire preparation, ensemble listening, rehearsal and performance etiquette, and full-score study.</li>
					<li>Two concluding concerts in two different venues to give students an opportunity to deepen their understanding of the week's repertoire.</li>
				</ul>
