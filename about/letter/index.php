				<h1>A Letter from the Artistic Director</h1>
				
				<p>Music has always been for me, first and foremost, a social activity. From a very young age,
				whether I was part of choir, orchestra, or rock band, the act of collaborative music making held a
				special thrill for me. I am very deeply affected and excited by the experience of sharing something so
				personal as music with my fellow performers, and in turn sharing that experience with an audience.
				Now, passing this thrill on to my students – teaching the art of musical collaboration, to make music
				that moves them and their audience – has become for me one the particular joys of working with young
				musicians.</p>

				<p>In the 21st century, it is becoming even more important for musicians to be aware of how they
				connect with the world around them: both the world of their peers and that of their audience. As a
				conductor and teacher, I consider it my primary job to teach my students how to forge these
				connections. Unfortunately, our current system of orchestral training for young musicians only
				haphazardly gives students the tools needed to make such connections on a professional level. Section
				leading, cueing, ensemble listening, all of the subtle interactions that must happen within and in
				between the sections of an orchestra are rarely taught to young musicians in any kind of systematic
				way. Furthermore, most music programs focus exclusively on “the music,” neglecting to give young
				musicians the “life” skills that they will desperately need if they become professional musicians.</p>

				<p>In my decade of conducting youth orchestras, I have time and time again experienced the same
				frustration: in every group with which I have worked, a number of young musicians have stood out for
				their intelligence, their genuine passion for and curiosity about the music being played, and their innate
				leadership abilities – and yet, I have never felt able to address adequately the needs of these students
				within the established system of orchestral training. Too many other students in the room, too many
				varying attention spans, too much focus on the concert alone, and often only one mentor (me) to guide
				the entire endeavor. I have often wished that I could take these incredibly gifted students into one
				small, intimate chamber orchestra, where they can truly develop the passions and skills that they so
				obviously display.</p>

				<p>Praxis Youth Leadership Orchestra seeks to fill this unfortunate gap. We provide serious young
				musicians with the opportunity to learn the exciting and subtle art of orchestral performance in an
				intimate and collegial musical environment, learning first hand from professional musicians. Our focus
				is above all on building an ensemble that our students feel is really theirs, something of which they can
				be truly proud to take ownership. We provide students with leadership and interactive skills that will
				serve them well for the rest of their lives, no matter what careers they end up choosing. Praxis seeks to
				create musicians who are both musically and socially responsible, conscientious citizens of the both the
				musical and the greater world.</p>
