				<img class="inline" src="../_includes/img/praxis11_mentoring.jpg">

				<p><strong>Praxis Youth Leadership Orchestra</strong> presents a radically new and innovative model of orchestral training for advanced young musicians in the New York City area. Founded on the philosophy that young musicians learn most when rehearsing and performing alongside experienced professionals, Praxis is a chamber-sized orchestra in which 11 young professional musicians mentor and coach 20-25 students through every step of the music-making process, in addition to being full-time members of the ensemble.</p>
				<p>Through this intensive and detailed coaching, Praxis equips its students with leadership, collaborative and organizational skills necessary for life as a professional musician. The training provided by Praxis prepares students to actively engage in and shape the world of music in the 21st century.</p>
				
				<p>Praxis provides:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>A chamber-sized orchestra in which 20-25 students (aged 18 and under) and 11 faculty-mentors play side-by-side in every rehearsal and performance, ensuring that each student receives intensive, detailed and personalized coaching.</li>
					<li>Rotating seating to give each member a chance to learn and contribute from multiple perspectives and to understand how each musician influences the sound of the whole ensemble.</li>
					<li>Special mentoring sessions led by established musicians from top-level chamber ensembles and professional orchestras in addition to the regular sectionals led by our faculty of professional musicians.</li>
					<li>Multiple performances of wide-ranging repertoire in both traditional and non-traditional venues and concert scenarios.</li>
					<li>Close work with established and up-and-coming composers through special commissions and reading sessions.</li>
					<li>Innovative collaborations with fellow young artists from the worlds of dance, theater and visual arts.</li>
					<li>Special mentoring sessions with professionals from other areas of the music world, ranging from music copyright lawyers to rock drummers to record label owners.</li>
					<li>Cultivation of life-long skills beyond instrumental playing through involvement in multiple aspects of the organization, including fund-raising, promotion, rehearsal and concert set-up, and repertoire planning.</li>
				</ul>
